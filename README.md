## uTerm


uTerm (micro-Term) is a VT100-like terminal for the Z80-MBC2 (https://hackaday.io/project/159973). It has a VGA out and PS/2 keyboard connector, a power supply for the Z80-MBC2 and a "transparent" serial-USB port.

This fork of https://github.com/SuperFabius/uTerm was originally made for supporting German Keyboard-Layout.
Then, I recognized, that some kind of keyboards with PS/2 doesn't react at the given firmware. They are just sending out 0xAA all the time and no key codes. By comparing the signals to a system, where they are working fine, I found that they need a reset (0xff), to work propperly.
This fork solve therefore three things:

1. the state machine for the keyboard has been changed to support this kind of keyboards, which are waiting for reset.
2. the right alt key is now used as a separate modifier to support the ALTGR-Codes on many non US-Keyboard-Layouts.
3. the keys are changed corresponding to German Layout

To compile this code, I used Keil ÂµVision5 under Windows X!

Here comes the original Text:

These are the sources modified for the uTerm forked from the Madis Kaal 
repository (forked from the original repository of K. C. Lee:

NOTE: I've updated here only the changed source files, so you must recompile all to get the new executable.

Supported uTerm boards:

- A071218-R250119
- A071218-R290319

Supported uTerm-S boards:

- A200419

**UPDATE (11/2019):** Solved a bug (by gkaufman) using the right CTRL key in some situations (i.e. CTRL-L)
